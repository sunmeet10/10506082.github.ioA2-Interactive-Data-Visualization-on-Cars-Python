# Introduction
We have used a dataset of different types of cars and trucks. Specifications are given for 427 new vehicles for the year 2004. The attributes include price, fuel efficiency, quantitative measurements relating to the size of the vehicle. In this dataset, we have 427 observations with 27 variables.

Determining Initial Questions For Analysis
Getting Insights about the data and which attributes are related to each other
Dataset Analysis: We have created a dashboard in Python that links all our visualizations and analysis.

To understand, letâ€™s look at the individual aspects of the dashboard

# 1.Horse power vs Retail price($): This scatter plots compares the horse power and retail price of each vehicle.
